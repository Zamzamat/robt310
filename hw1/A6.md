# Hw1 A6

## Inputs:
 - Dimensions of a Matrixes
 - Formula
 - Problems

## Outputs:
 - One Python code for all Problems
 - % Image outputs for Task A: [A1:A5]
 - This file
 - Video explanation on Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xiHcTs0yGqvo59twemQCxJZ0UA9GsND7

## Observations: 
 - For this course I am coding in NeoVim on Termux on Android Tablet, which is time consuming, but there are more pros. Such as I do not need to bring my heavy 5kg BackPack with Laptop and Charger for the whole day. Vim is a superior skill and a huge flex in todays reality, where vibecoding is a major trend. It makes me to think harder and deeper on every process execution.
 - instead of popular library Pillow, I use numpy + imageio. Pillow is great, and etc, but too heavy for Termux, and overkill for this HW tasks. Numpy + imageio feels as simple as Matlab.
 - I still want to keep coding on 0.5kg Tablet, so in future when I face Problems need more powerfull hardware I shall find a way for easy and fast execution of .py files somewhere in cloud, not directly on Tablet.
 
 ## Struggles:
 - I am not familiar with all the shorctus in Vim and its powerfull perks, as Plugins.
 - Low-expirience in Git
 - Images in Termux are saved in Directories, where Android Gallery has no access.


~ Solutions are clearly commented in .py code. ~
